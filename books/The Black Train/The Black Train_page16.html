He hoisted his bra beneath a tight blouse.</p><p>  They seemed to be shielding the conversation from Collier, but even through the alcohol haze, he could hear traces: “He’s supposed to slip me a ten each time.” “He probably went out the back.” “How do you like that!”</p><p>  The extra beers were exactly not what Collier needed. He felt narcotized. “Problem?” he asked, when the keep came back.</p><p>  “No, no biggie, Mr. Collier. But I’m afraid Jiff’s gone; he must’ve left out the back door. If he comes in later, I’ll tell him you were looking for him.”</p><p>  “I’m sure I’ll see him back at the inn…”</p><p>  A Pabst clock told him it was past two thirty now. Less than five hours and I’m on a date with Dominique…The fact buffed off the weirdness of his current situation. He was determined to leave soon; he needed some time to nap off his buzz. He had one more beer to be polite, but then his head was spinning. He put a twenty down for a tip, took another fifteen minutes saying good-bye to everyone, and at last stumbled out into daylight.</p><p>  Holy smokes, I’m drunk out of my gourd…</p><p>  He had to concentrate on each step. Focus, focus! he ordered. If he fell down on the sidewalk, everyone would see. By the time he got to the end of the street, that last beer was overriding his liver. Collier walked as though he had cinder blocks tied to his shoes. Don’t fall, don’t fall, don’t fall, he kept thinking.</p><p>  When he looked down Number 3 Street, he saw a drove of tourists moving toward him. There’s no way I can fake it, he knew, and with my luck they’ll all want autographs. I’m so stewed right now I doubt that I could sign my name…He made a forty-five-degree pivot on the sidewalk—Here goes!—and walked right into the woods.</p><p>  I’ll walk through the woods around the hill. No one’ll see me, and that’s a good thing because I’m pretty damn sure I’m gonna fall on my face a couple of times.</p><p>  Among the trees, he found a convenient footpath, then—</p><p>  flump!</p><p>  —fell flat on his face.</p><p>  The town buffoon, he thought. Me. Washed-up TV hasbeen alcoholic wreck and L.A. burnout useless waste of space! Gets shit-faced in the middle of the afternoon…Collier hoped there was no afterlife. He didn’t want to think that his dear dead parents might be seeing him now, lamenting tearily, “Where did we go wrong?”</p><p>  He dragged himself up, then lurched from tree to tree for about a hundred yards. He could only sense where the inn was. Over there someplace, he thought, and gazed drunkenly left. He squinted through double vision, saw that he still had about four hours before his date…</p><p>  I can’t make it, I need to sit down for a little while. His butt thunked to the ground, and he thought he heard the seat rip open. He heard something else, too, a steady disconnected noise…</p><p>  Running water?</p><p>  He shot his face forward and thought he saw a creek burbling through the woods. I ought to go put my face in that, he considered, but now that he was down, he wasn’t getting up. There was no bed to spin here, only the woods.</p><p>  He nodded in and out. The steady sound of the creek reminded him of those sleep-machine things that supposedly offered calming sounds but only wound up alerting the sleeper. He nodded off again, quite heavily. He felt as though he were being buried in sand.</p><p>  Pieces of dreams pecked at him: the clang of railroad workers, and men singing like a chain gang. He dreamed of Penelope Gast fanning herself in a posh parlor as female maids tended to her, and then he dreamed of the smell of urine.</p><p>  A splendid horizon, into which a steam locomotive chugged briskly, smoke pouring, and a whistle screeching as it disappeared into the distance…</p><p>  “I wanna do it, too,” the voice of a young girl whined.</p><p>  “Don’t be stupid!” insisted another older-sounding girl.</p><p>  The brook burbled on, but beneath it crept a fainter sound:</p><p>  scritch-scritch-scritch</p><p>  “Then let me do it to you…”</p><p>  “You’re too little, stupid! You’d cut me!”</p><p>  “No I wouldn’t!”</p><p>  Something like alarm pried open Collier’s eyes. The voices weren’t from a dream. He craned his neck and stared forward, at two young girls doing something near the creek. One dirty blonde who looked about thirteen or fourteen, and the other about ten, with a ruffled helmet-cut like a 1920s flapper, the color of dark chocolate. They were both barefoot, wearing white smocklike dresses.</p><p>  Shit! Two little kids, and they don’t know I’m here, Collier realized. It would likely scare them if he announced himself. The young one stepped into the water and continued looking down at the other, who sat with her back to Collier and seemed to be leaning over.</p><p>  scritch-scritch-scritch</p><p>  What the hell is she doing? Then Collier almost screamed when a feisty mud-colored dog trounced in his lap and began licking his face. “Jesus!”</p><p>  Both girls looked over, and the younger one said, “Look. A man’s there,” in a sharp Southern accent.</p><p>  The blonde’s accent seemed more lazy. “Hey, mister. That’s just our dog. Don’t worry, he don’t bite.”</p><p>  “He’s a good dog!”</p><p>  Collier had to palm the dog back. He wasn’t sure, but in the animal’s enthusiasm, he thought it might be humping his leg.</p><p>  “Leave the man alone!” one of them squalled.</p><p>  The mutt broke off, running excited circles in the clearing. But Collier knew at once: That’s the dog I…think…I saw in my room.</p><p>  “What are you doin’ there, mister?” the dark-haired one squawked. She had smudges of dirt on her dress, and there was something about the way she stood and the way she looked at him that seemed hyperactive.</p><p>  “I, uh, oh, I was just taking a nap.”</p><p>  “Too much whiskey, huh, mister?” supposed the older one. She kept her back to him, and was leaning over as if looking into the creek.</p><p>  “An alkie!” the younger girl half shrieked. “A rummy, like Mother says! Says there’s lots of ’em.”</p><p>  Collier’s head thunked. “No, no, I’m staying at the inn.” Then he lied. “It’s nothing like that. I was just taking a nap in the woods, because it’s nice out.”</p><p>  “Rummy! Rummy!” The little girl danced in the water, while the mongrel joined her.</p><p>  Precocious little shit, Collier thought.</p><p>  “Shut up, Cricket. Don’t be disrespectful…”</p><p>  scritch-scritch-scritch</p><p>  Collier felt he had to prove something now. Very carefully he stood up, and noticed that he’d slept off some of the drunk. Some but not all. Careful. He walked over. “What are you girls doing over here? I hear this noise.”</p><p>  The dirty blonde looked up, smiled with a doughy face that seemed to droop. Her eyes looked dull in spite of the big, proud smile. “I’m shavin’ my legs, ’cos I’m a young lady now, and I gotta do ladylike things.”</p><p>  “That’s what our mother says,” the younger one seemed to regret. “I can’t wait till I’m a young lady, too, so I can shave my legs.”</p><p>  Collier almost winced at the sight. A cup of shaving lather sat beside the blonde, and indeed, she was shaving her legs in the creek, with an old-fashioned straight razor.</p><p>  scritch-scritch-scritch</p><p>  Then she splashed the lather off with creek water.</p><p>  “Oh, wow, you should be careful,” Collier warned. “You ought to do that at home. If you cut yourself, you could get all kind of germs from that water.”</p><p>  Both girls traded bewildered glances. Now the blonde splashed off some more, shot her gleaming legs up. She wriggled her feet in the air, and seemed pleased with the effect. “There,” she drawled. “All smooth now, just like a real lady.” The doughy face beamed back up. “My name’s Mary, and this here’s my sister, Cricket. I’m fourteen, she’s eleven.”</p><p>  “Hi,” Collier said, and tasted a waft of old beer.</p><p>  The younger girl jumped out of the w<br>ater and poked him with a finger. “What’s your name, mister?”</p><p>  “Justin.”</p><p>  A toothy grin turned Cricket’s face into a lined mask. “You ain’t one’a them fellas who messes with little girls, are ya? Ya don’t look like it.”</p><p>  Out of here! Collier thought. Kids these days—they see all this molestation stuff on Oprah. “No, no, but you girls have a good day, I have to go.”</p><p>  “Aw, Cricket! What’cha say that for? Now you got him scared. Don’t go, mister. She’s just teasin’.”</p><p>  “No, I’ve got to—” He winced again. “Please, Mary, be careful with that razor—”</p><p>  Now she was doing her underarms, rather obliviously. Scritch-scritch-scritch. She shaved the lather out of one armpit, then flipped it off the blade into the water. Collier noticed a thread-thin line of red.</p><p>  “See, you’ve cut yourself—”</p><p>  “Aw, it’s just a nick, but I can’t do it right with this hand.” She held up her index finger.</p><p>  First glance made Collier think she was wearing a fat dark ring but then he realized it was a bruise.</p><p>  “I got one, too, but not as bad.” Cricket showed her own finger. “I stole a piece of sugarloaf from the store and got caught.” A manic giggle. “But that ain’t as bad as what Mary got caught doin’—”</p><p>  “Shut up!”</p><p>  The gritted-teeth mask again. “She got five minutes ’cos she got caught kissin’ a boy at school!”</p><p>  Mary laid a hard hand across the back of her sister’s thigh. The sound cracked through the woods.</p><p>  “Ow!”</p><p>  “Serves ya right. Mister, don’t listen to her.”</p><p>  Collier’s mind churned over too much at once. Who were these girls? Were they staying at the inn? Collier doubted it. Probably a trailer park nearby. Then: Those bruises, he pondered. He couldn’t forget Mrs. Butler’s painful demonstration of the “Naughty Girl Clips” in the display case…</p><p>  scritch-scritch-scritch</p><p>  “Oh, please, you really shouldn’t do that…”</p><p>  Now the blonde was shaving the other armpit.</p><p>  “Do mine next, do mine next!” Cricket insisted.</p><p>  “There ain’t nothin’ to shave!” Mary almost wailed. “You ain’t got no hair yet!” Another gleeful smile shot back to Collier. “She’s jealous, mister, ’cos I got hair and she don’t. I got the blood, too.”</p><p>  Collier’s throat thickened. “The…blood?”</p><p>  “The Curse of Eve, like our mother told us ’bout. Eve did somethin’ bad in the Garden of Eden, so now all girls get the curse. But the curse gives us hair. Ain’t that right, mister?”</p><p>  Collier stood speechless. He cleared his throat and asked, “Are you, uh, are you girls from town?”</p><p>  “Oh, yeah. We was born here.”</p><p>  “Where are your parents?”</p><p>  Cricket wriggled her toes in creek mud. “Our father’s away workin’ and our mother’s at home. Where you from, mister?”</p><p>  “California—”</p><p>  Both girls traded another glance that seemed in awe.</p><p>  “—but I’m just visiting here. I’m staying at Mrs. Butler’s inn.”</p><p>  Mary splashed off her other armpit. It occurred to Collier just then that, for sisters, the girls couldn’t have looked more different.</p><p>  “We don’t know no Mrs. Butler.”</p><p>  Must be from a nearby town, and wandered over here. But…had it really been that dog he’d seen last night? No. It was just a dream. Just a hallucination…</p><p>  Yet it wasn’t too far-fetched to think that the dog may have gotten inside. Mrs. Butler had even suggested the possibility.</p><p>  “Oh, yeah,” Mary informed. “There’s a man at the cooper’s named Butler, but he ain’t got no wife.”</p><p>  Cricket piped in, “One time he was all drunk and he offered us half a dollar to show him our—”</p><p>  “Cricket! Be quiet!”</p><p>  Collier’s contemplations stretched like taffy.</p><p>  “Hey!” Cricket wailed now. “What’choo doin’?”</p><p>  The dog frolicked in the water, chasing plops of floating shave cream. It seemed to be trying to eat them.</p><p>  “He’s a silly dog,” Mary offered.</p><p>  “Sometimes real silly…”</p><p>  Now the dog yipped, thrashing circles in the woods. At one point it stopped abruptly, to defecate. It seemed to look right at Collier.</p><p>  “He’s poopin’!”</p><p>  “I have to go—good-bye,” Collier said quickly and began to walk off.</p><p>  “Don’t go yet!” Cricket objected. “Don’t’cha wanna watch Mary shave her…”</p><p>  Collier lengthened his strides.</p><p>  As he made off, he heard:</p><p>  scritch-scritch-scritch</p><p>  He walked straight in spite of the dizziness: half drunk, half hungover. He slowed his pace up the hill he hoped to God would take him back to the inn. White-trash kids or something, he guessed. Poor, negligent parents, no decent role models. It happened everywhere. Then he thought: Or maybe…</p><p>  Maybe it was another hallucination.</p><p>  The finger clips? The dog? A young girl shaving her legs in a creek?</p><p>  The half-heard sound of giggling stopped him. But he must be a hundred yards away now.</p><p>  Some perverted gremlin in his psyche made him turn against his will.</p><p>  And peer back down into the woods.</p><p>  The girls were still at the creek. “Dirty dog!” Cricket reveled amid a flood of more giggling that could only be Mary’s.</p><p>  Collier’s stomach turned at what he saw, or thought he saw. Then he jogged as best he could for the inn.</p><p>  CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>  I</p><p>  1861</p><p>  “Good work, men!” Morris barked to slaves and white men alike. He stood before the work site on the back of the rear guiding car for the pallet train. Then he shielded his eyes and looked down the line as dusk approached. “I say it looks to me like some mighty good work! Wouldn’t you agree, Mr. Poltrock?”</p><p>  Poltrock stood aside, distracted. He was looking at the numbers: how many iron track rails and fish-bolt plates the crew had consumed since last Friday. Can that be right?</p><p>  Morris grinned at him, hands on hips. “I guess Mr. Poltrock didn’t hear me—” All the rest of the men, the Negroes included, laughed.</p><p>  Poltrock snapped out of it. “Yes, Mr. Morris. Perhaps even better than mighty fine…”</p><p>  Morris’s long hair lifted in a breeze. “Until Sunday mornin’ then”—one of the strong-armers clanged the bell—“we are all off shift!”</p><p>  Roughly a hundred and fifty men disbanded from their ranks, shining in sweat, bent by fatigue, but cheering as they broke away for the campsites. The bell clanged on, jarring Poltrock’s brain.</p><p>  “End of another week.” Morris rubbed his hands together. “Hard to believe we’re deep in Georgia territory now. Goin’ on four years, ain’t it? Seems like ’bout six, eight months, if you ask me.”</p><p>  Poltrock barely heard him. Only then did he notice a long side-knife in a tin scabbard flapping on Morris’s hip. “Mr. Morris, what is that thing on your hip? Looks part sword, part D-guard knife.”</p><p>  The blade whispered when Morris unsheathed the fourteen-inch tool. “It’s called a saber-bayonet, sir. Fancy, ain’t it? It’s made’a folded steel from the Kenansville Armory. They add somethin’ called chromium to the metal—shit won’t rust even if ya leave it in a bucket’a water overnight. And the brass hilt’s so hard you can use it for a hammer.”</p><p>  “Why’s a crew chief need a knife that long?”</p><p>  “Don’t really need it at all—” Morris turned the blade till it flashed. “It’s just…pretty, I guess. Women got their fussy jewelry, but men got their guns and knives, I suppose.”</p><p>  The point had never crossed Poltrock’s mind, but it was novel. “Now that you mention it, I guess I feel much the same ’bout my Colt .36,” he said, and gestured to the revolver on his hip. “Don’t have much real use for it neither, not with this army of strong-armers Mr. Gast’s hired on. If the slaves were gonna rebel, they’d’ve tried that a long time<br> ago.”</p><p>  “They’d have to be crazy to rebel,” Morris said. “They’ll be free men when we’re done. A’course, there are still some Indians who get their dander up. All of us’d be wise to always carry somethin’ for protection.”</p><p>  “Forearmed is forewarned…Or is it the other way around?”</p><p>  “Speakin’ of Indians—” Morris peered out past the work site.</p><p>  Poltrock saw some figures straggling toward them.</p><p>  “Beggars, probably. Or maybe some whores for tonight,” Morris presumed. “But gettin’ back to what we were talkin’ ’bout—time’s goin’ by so fast. I wanted to ask how many miles’a track have we laid so far? Bet we’re surely past 350, don’tcha think?”</p><p>  “I only add the monthlies up twice a year, but—shit—yeah. Fast as it seems we’re goin’ we could be close to 350. We could be.”</p><p>  “You fixin’ to count up the week now?”</p><p>  “Yes, but don’t let Mr. Fecory leave till I get back. Probably take me a half hour.”</p><p>  “I’ll tell him,” Morris said. He was squinting at the slow approaching figures. “It’ll take him more than that to pay the white crew anyhow.” Now Morris slapped some dust from his beard. “And I am ready for some whiskey tonight. How ’bout you?”</p><p>  Poltrock closed his notebook, still perplexed by his numbers. “What’s that? Oh, yeah, maybe…”</p><p>  Mr. Gast gave everyone Saturday off, but Poltrock often wondered about the man’s choice of days.</p><p>  Sunday was the typical day of rest.</p><p>  Nevertheless, things could get fairly wild. Whiskey was brought in, and several head of cattle. And some squaws were allowed on the grounds, too. Eshquas, they were called. Mr. Gast didn’t mind some whore tents being set up for Friday nights, for the whites to use to relieve their tensions.</p><p>  Poltrock’s mind snagged on something. “Wait a minute. Now that I think of it, I remember the quartermaster tellin’ me earlier that no whiskey had been delivered today. I didn’t see any supply train come in earlier, did you?”</p><p>  “Damned to hell. No, I didn’t.” Morris appeared as though a bad taste had come into his mouth.</p><p>  “I know that a coupla times, Mr. Gast bought kegs of whiskey from the nearby towns. Don’t make sense to train it in from home every week—”</p><p>  <br> </p></p></body>
