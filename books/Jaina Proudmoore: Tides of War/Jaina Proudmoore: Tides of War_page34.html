Regardless of the side you choose, your adventures will have impact on Azeroth’s destiny. Ancient evils are on the rise across the enchanted isle of Pandaria, threatening to engulf the world in darkness unless you stop them.</p><p>  To discover the ever-expanding realm that has entertained millions around the globe, go to WorldofWarcraft.com and download the free trial version.
