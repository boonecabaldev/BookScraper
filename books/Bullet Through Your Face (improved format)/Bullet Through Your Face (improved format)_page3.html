I mean, you got the girl. I’m sure she’d be a hell of a lot better than me.”</p><p>  Gray shrieked when Hull slapped his head again. “What-choo talkin’ ‘bout!” Hull took exception. “Kari Ann? She’s our sister! That’d be insesteriss! What kinda pree-verts ya think we is?”</p><p>  Gray’s brain felt like a single, throbbing blob of pain. Pardon me for making the inference, he thought, as pissed off as he was terrified, but it’s not like I’m seeing a whole lot of morality here. You just RAPED ME in the ass.</p><p>  “Shee-it. I oughts ta cut me off one’a yer balls juss fer sayin’such a dirty thing.”</p><p>  “Sorry,” Gray sputtered.</p><p>  But Jory railed, “Dag damn, Hull! I’se gonna have myself a good come up his this fella’s backside. Second nut’a the day’s always the best, I say.” Jory knelt and turned Gray around, jerking up at his hips. “Feels good!”</p><p>  “Best not ta fight it, City,” Hull obliged. “We’se gonna have ya one ways’re another. Don’t make me git ta cuttin’ on ya.”</p><p>  Gray’s eyes widened in more truth. What could he do? Moreover, what would they do when they were finished? It wasn’t like he was going anywhere, not chained to the fucking floor. The rationale of survival set its teeth: I’ve got no choice . . .</p><p>  Hull flexed his hairy pecs. “You’s gonna give me a peter-suck while’s Jory here checks yer oil.”</p><p>  Gray, fully on hands and knees now, nodded grimly. He winced at the sound of Jory clearing his throat and expectorating into the cleft of his buttocks. “Gots ta slick ya up some, huh, City? Give that tight l’il boy-poon a good lubin’.”</p><p>  “Jory, see, he don’t much care fer a peter-suck, says it tickles,” Hull enlightened. “Pur-fers a cornholin’ any day. But me? I’se just the opper-sit. Don’t care to have a fella’s shit on my stick much, ya know? But a good peter-suck—that’s what I’se pur-fer.”</p><p>  “Time to park the car in the garage,” Jory quipped, kneeling right up now behind Gray. Gray’s cheek’s billowed at the sensation: a wet nudge . . . forward pressure, then . . .</p><p>  slunk Jory’s “car” pulled deftly into Gray’s “garage.” Gray blew out more air. The pain was not nearly as paramount as the sheer pressure. Jory’s callused hands held Gray’s hips as he began to draw in and out. Christ, this motherfucker’s huge! Gray had no choice but to observe. It feels like I’m taking a shit in reverse . . .</p><p>  “Luckys fer you that Hull don’t fancy a lot’a cornholin’, ‘cos his dog’s even bigger’n mine.”</p><p>  Hull chuckled. “Now come on, Jory. Ain’t ya got no manners? When yer cornholin’ a fella it’s only proper’n courteous ta at least give him a reach-around!”</p><p>  Jory pumped now in a steady rhythm, each stroke seeming to reach up into Gray’s guts. “Aw, City, I’se truly do apoler-gize. That ain’t very hospital of me at all, now, is it?” Jory reached under Gray’s right hip and grabbed his penis and scrotum. He squeezed it probingly several times, as though it were an udder on a cow. “Shee-it, Hull, I say this boy ain’t got much at all!”</p><p>  Gray’s genitals felt like a bag of dead flesh.</p><p>  Hull grinned through rotten teeth. “He gittin’ hard?”</p><p>  “Shee-it, Hull! Hard? This here city fella here? Peter on him feels about as hard as a chicken liver! And I say, his nuts don’t feel hardly no bigger’n a coupla olives!”</p><p>  “Bet he don’t come much neithers.” Hull knelt before Gray’s face, inched up closer on his knees, and fully pulled down his overalls. “Well, here’s something for ya, City.” He used his full hand to extract his genitals. “Like a big hot lollipop.”</p><p>  Gray’s eyes opened to the size of Kennedy dollars. You’ve got to be shitting me! If Gray, on a good day, sported six and a quarter inches, well . . . you could add about three more inches to that and it still wouldn’t be as big as Hull’s, and who cares if it was a good day? What hung immediately before Gray’s face was something that looked like an erect summer sausage—with a snout on the end. Folds of abundant foreskin looked like bunched lunchmeat. “You suck on this good, City,” Hull said, then flashed the point of the buck knife toward his face. “Ands if you even think ‘bout bitin’ it, so helps me, I’ll’se dig yer eyeball out’n make ya eat it. Hear me?”</p><p>  Gray, puff-eyed, nodded.</p><p>  Hull pulled back the foreskin—a veritable sheet of loose skin— to reveal a damp pink glans with a ring of smegma girding the rim. “Git yer yap open, City, like at the doctor’s office, open wide’n say ahhh. And don’t mind the dick cheese. Hail, a l’il cheese won’t hurt ya. Give ya something ta taste, huh?”</p><p>  Gray, mortified now, squeezed his eyes shut and opened his mouth, and what was then inserted into said mouth reminded him of a raw turkey neck. Only bigger. “Reach up’n give my balls a squeeze too,” Hull eloquently requested. Gray had to lean all his forward weight on one palm when he did so. And what his hand enclosed felt like two kiwi fruits.</p><p>  Only bigger.</p><p>  “Come on, City! Shee-it! You kins suck a dog better’n that. Suck it like yer daddy taught ya.”</p><p>  This may come as a surprise to you, sir, but my father DIDN’T teach me how to suck dick . . . Gray reasoned that his survival just now might very well depend on the dexterity by which he performed fellatio on this unwashed hayseed. And unwashed was an understatement. With his mouth so full, he had no recourse but to breathe through his nose, and with each inhalation came the most nefarious fetors. Jesus, he thought. I’ve never sucked dick before. How am I supposed to know how to do it? But he thought about that, and came to a conclusion. Suck it the way the girl sucked you...</p><p>  He tried to abstract, and formulate his own method of expertise. A few agonizing slaps to the head indicated that his initial efforts weren’t satisfactory, but then . . . Then he abstracted further: He pretended he was fellating himself. He kept the inside of his mouth wet, his lips tight, and his tongue firm against the basal shaft.</p><p>  He thought he must be getting the hang of it but then Hull sputtered, “Fuckin’ useless piece’a shit. Might as well just kill ya now. Any guy gives head bad as you don’t deserve ta live.”</p><p>  The comment was not encouraging, but at least it served as an incentive. Just . . . suck his dick better, for God’s sake! Gray thought. He stepped up the tempo, his mouth vised open as if by a shoe-tree. He tried to suck harder, feeling a slimy leakage begin to form on his tongue.</p><p>  “Hmm. Not bad, I say. Gittin’better. Keep goin’jess like that an’ I might not cut’cher throat tonight. Naw, might even keep ya alive fer one more.”</p><p>  The rewards of perseverance. But Gray knew he couldn’t let him get bored. Then an idea blinked on.</p><p>  Like the girl, he thought.</p><p>  He remembered. How could he forget? Lubricant, came the frantic thought. The cock plungering in and out of his ass gave him the answer quite quickly. Jory had used saliva. So will I, Gray realized. He momentarily uncorked his mouth from Hull’s hot penis, then he laved his own index finger with his spit, then—</p><p>  “City’s got some brains after all,” Hull chuckled when Gray reached his hand around and slipped his finger into the man’s anus. It plowed through chunky feces. Gray re-jammed the cock into his mouth, wriggling his finger.</p><p>  “Yeah, City! That’s it! Now ya got it!”</p><p>  “Bet Kari Ann taught him that,” Jory deduced, picking up his own tempo. Gray grimly felt Jory’s testicle’s slapping his own with each thrust forward. “Bet she done the same thing’n sucked his little peter in the car.”</p><p>  “Bet so.” “Little jizz-head’s always been dumber’n cow flop but at least we taught her how ta do somethin’ right.”</p><p>  Mouth crammed with dick, Gray rolled his eyes. Didn’t these guys just crack me in the head for implying that they might be incestuous? Go figure. All that mattered at this instant was that he wasn’t getting cracked in the head again, for performing mediocre fellatio. His index finger tilled through more hillbilly shit, teasing the prostate, while his mo<br>uth was fastidiously fucked. Gray’s ass was being fucked with equal fastidiousness.More smegma dissolved on his tongue—an acrid yet pale flavor—and he willed himself to think about smells other than those which wafted from Hull’s groin. Roses. Cranberry Lambic. Vanilla extract and his mother’s hot apple pie. Reflex, however, caused his rectum to flinch, via such an intrusive invasion, but then Jory approved, “Hull? I say this here fella’s one hail of a butt-fuck. Squeezes up his butthole real tight on my bone! Why, I’se still say this boy’s the blammed best cornholing I’se ever had!”</p><p>  “And ya’s know what, Jor?” Hull replied, stroking steadily into Gray’s mouth, “he kin suck a peter like there’s no tuh-marruh!”</p><p>  “Shee-it, I’se-I’se-I’se think I’se gonna come alls-ready. Pinch that butthole, boy! Squeeze it!”</p><p>  Gray squeezed it, flexing intricate muscles he scarcely knew he had. Then—</p><p>  Jory’s fingers dug into his hips, his strokes faltering. “Aw, yeah, I say yeah! I’se comin’ in this fella like a firehose!”</p><p>  Gray wasn’t sure he agreed with the simile. More like a turkey baster full of hot egg-drop soup being aspirated deep into his bowel. Gray could feel it, he could feel the wet, gluelike heat spurt and then settle. And, next, Hull’s own strokes accelerated. “Shee-it, git it, City, git it! I’se gonna—”</p><p>  The entirety of Gray’s face seemed to swell shut when Hull ejaculated into his mouth. It was a voluminous ejaculation. Long hot spurts, like velotic pieces of spaghetti, launched to the back of his throat.</p><p>  “Fuckin’-A.” There was nearly an audible pop when Hull withdrew the deflating—and elephantine—member, then his hand snatched up Gray’s chin. “Swaller it now, City. Be a good l’il cock-suck ands swaller it all. Swaller alls that good come right down inta yer breadbasket ‘nless ya want yer eye digged out.”</p><p>  Gray didn’t want his eye “digged” out, so he “swallered.” And what it was exactly that he swallered was something that reminded him of a mouthful of hot, thin snot. He winced, nearly gagged, then gulped.</p><p>  And down it went.</p><p>  It left a warm, strangely minty aftertrail down his esophagus. “Hail of a come, Jory. Fella sucks a peter better’n a fifty-year-old whore.”</p><p>  “Take a cock up the tail just as good, I say,” Jory elucidated.</p><p>  “Ain’t never, I say never, had me a cornhole so’s good. Came enough ta fill a milk bucket, I did!”</p><p>  Gray pulled his finger out of Hull’s ass and was then allowed to collapse to his belly. Chain links clinked. He could smell the fresh excrement on his finger.</p><p>  “Kinda neat, ain’t it?” Hull speculated. “I means he gotta belly fulla my come, an’ a butt fulla yers.”</p><p>  “Yeahs,” Jory agreed. “Too bad it ain’t winter. All that come’d keep him warm.”</p><p>  Gray’s cheek lay against the floor. Thank God it’s over. But . . . Exhausted, he turned over on his back, his Italian slacks bunched at his knees. What he saw, absurdly, appalled him. Jory was using his</p><p>  X’andrini black silk shirt as a rag to wipe off his genitals with. “Man, that shirt cost two hundred bucks.”</p><p>  “Worth it,” Jory grinned. “You’s the best cornhole I’se ever had, an’ this city-faggot shirt’s the best dick-wipe. Soft.”</p><p>  Upside-down, Gray watched Hull stick his fat, deflated penis back into his overalls. Then he stood up. “T’was a dandy nut, City. You done good. An’ ‘cos you done such a fine job’a takin’ care’a us, we’ll’se send Kari Ann up with some viddles fer ya.”</p><p>  “An’ we’ll’se visit ya agin tuh-marruh,” Jory promised.</p><p>  “Hopes ya like yer dinner, City.” Hull chuckled, turned, then slapped his brother on the shoulder. “Come on, Jor. Let’s git downstairs now’n git ta work on them cars.”</p><p>  Their booted feet clunked down the stairs. A doorlock clicked.</p><p>  Then Gray passed out.</p><p>  “Wake up. Hey.” Something in a dream patted him on the cheek, jostled him. But when Gray opened his eyes, he saw it was no dream at all. It was still the same nightmare.</p><p>  Haltered breasts swayed. The girl’s face hovered over his. “Wakes up there. I’se got some food’n water fer ya.”</p><p>  Gray leaned up. At least the pain in his head didn’t feel as pronounced, and as for the pain in his anus--it felt more numb than anything. When he rubbed his face, he winced; he could smell his finger. When he sat up, the chain dragged a little. He could imagine how ludicrous he looked—in spite of the horror his predicament presented: he was naked, save for his t-shirt and black dress socks.</p><p>  “Here ya go. Sorry I ain’t’s got no spoon. Yer’s gonna have ta eat it with yer fingers.”</p><p>  Gray’s vision focused on the object in her hand.</p><p>  A bucket.</p><p>  Actually, two buckets, one in the other hand. Just garden-variety buckets. Gray’s chain dragged when he sat up. For some reason, he tried to pull his t-shirt down over his exposed groin, as if he should be modest. Or could it be the fact that terror and violation had shrunk his genitals to what must look like a five-year-old’s? But the attempt was futile. He’d put on some weight lately; the t-shirt could only be pulled down to the top of his pubic hair.</p><p>  “What’s in the buckets?” “This bucket here?” She held one up, then set it down in the corner. “It’s fer—Well, you know.”</p><p>  “No, I don’t know,” Gray replied testily.</p><p>  “It’s fer ya to pee in, and . . .”</p><p>  A shit-bucket, great. Well what do you know? There’s a men’s room here. I wonder if there’s an attendant to go along with it, to pump the soap for me when I wash my hands.</p><p>  His sarcasm served no purpose. The wood floor felt warm on his bare, ghoul-white buttocks. But what was that smell? No, not the awful smell of dried shit on his finger—there was a pale aroma in the room.</p><p>  She set the other bucket down. It steamed.</p><p>  “This here’s yer dinner,” she told him, and something close to delight tickled Gray.</p><p>  “Thank God, I’m starving.” After being abducted, beaten, and raped? After spending the night nearly naked and chained to a wood floor? You bet. Some sustenance was just what he needed to focus on his predicament, and think of a way to get out of here.</p><p>  “What is it?” he asked. “It smells sort of familiar, but I can’t quite place it,” and then she slid the bucket to him.</p><p>  “I cooked it up for ya. Don’t really know how to, so’s I figured I’d steam it.”</p><p>  Gray looked in the bucket. “You’ve got to be kidding me!” he outraged.</p><p>  Slabs of pumpkin lay in the steaming bucket.</p><p>  “Well, I’se sorry it ain’t nothin’ better, but that’s all they’se said I could give ya. Hull says we gots ta save money, an’ these pumpkins grow all over the yard.”</p><p>  Gray shot her a critical glare. “You don’t eat pumpkin, not as is.</p><p>  It’s just used for flavoring in pies!”</p><p>  “Hull says the Indians et pumpkin all the tam—”</p><p>  All the tam, Gray thought, disgusted.</p><p>  “—durin’ famines’n such when the pilgrims wanted ‘em ta starve.” Her eyes lit up, as if with enthusiasm. “But they didn’t starve, see, ‘cos they et pumpkin.”</p><p>  Gray just looked at her.</p><p>  “It ain’t that bad,” she encouraged. “Er, at least, probably it ain’t.”</p><p>  “Wonderful.” He pushed the steaming bucket away, no longer even mindful of his shrunken penis and scrotum. “I can’t possibly eat this.”</p><p>  “Well-well,” she stammered. “Ya best eat it all, ‘cos Jory says if ya don’t, they’ll come up here’n ruck ya about somethin’fierce.”</p><p>  “Great.” That’s what this was all about, wasn’t it? Maximum humiliation. Rape him, make him give blowjobs. Force him to eat pumpkin. And why? For the hell of it, Gray realized. If I don’t eat it, they’ll just kick my ass some more . . . and that’s not the only thing they’ll do with my ass . . .</p><p>  “‘Least it’ll be somethin’ in yer belly,” the girl suggested.</p><p>  She’s right about that. Gray<br> decided to think with some practicality. The pumpkin would provide some necessary nutrition, some energy, and he’d need that to get out of here. I’m about to eat hot pumpkin, with my hands. Or, hand, that is. The finger of one hand, of course, had been up Hull’s ass, and he didn’t want to be eating with that one. He reached in, pulled up a wedge. At least she’d seeded it. He took a bite, his face squeezing up, eating it like a watermelon.</p><p>  It did not taste like watermelon.</p><p>  “Is it good?” the girl asked.</p><p>  Gray just looked at her. It was not good. It was slimy, no sweetness whatever, just a mushy texture. He tried to tell himself it would taste like eggplant.</p><p>  But it did not taste like eggplant.</p><p>  “Bet it tastes like pumpkin pie, huh?”</p><p>  “No,” he groaned. She’d pronounced “pie” as “pah.” There was a pumpkin flavor, though, and at least he learned something. Hot pumpkin tastes like shit. In a constant wince, he ate the pumpkin’s whitish flesh off the orange skin, choking it down. It was awful.</p><p>  The girl was on her knees, leaning over as she watched. He could see her bare breasts inside the halter but just now even the most erotic image caused no reaction. As he started in on the second wedge, she kneed around behind him, rubbed his shoulders. “Anythin’ ya want me ta do fer ya?” she offered. “You kin fuck me if ya wants.”</p><p>  Gray smirked, cheeks stuffed with hot mush. “No, thanks.” “Wanna blowjob?”</p><p>  “No!” A chunk of pumpkin blew out of his mouth. “I’m not exactly in the mood, you know? Those animal brothers of yours raped me. And it’s your fault.”</p><p>  “It’s not!” Suddenly she was sobbing. “Just ‘cos they’se bad don’t mean I am!”</p><p>  “You’re worse,” Gray blurted. “You set me up. You lured me here—for them.”</p><p>  “I ain’t had no choice!” she nearly shrieked. “If I don’t do whats they say, they’se’ll kill me, and my baby!”</p><p>  Now she was blubbering hysterically. Swallowing more mush, Gray considered her words. She was just a stupid hill-girl, born into poverty, abused and tormented and subjugated from day one. What could Gray expect?</p><p>  <br> </p></p></body>
