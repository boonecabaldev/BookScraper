Snow blanketed everything. He couldn’t be certain if lumps were rocks or frozen corpses. It didn’t matter. The white flakes, some of which rose on swirling winds, hid everything with their innocence.</p><p>  Vol’jin willingly let them seduce him into believing the world, at least for a moment, was at peace.</p><p>  Taran Zhu appeared at his side. “Peace is a natural state. You may enjoy it here for as long as you wish.”</p><p>  “You be very kind, Lord Taran Zhu.”</p><p>  The pandaren smiled. “But you will not enjoy it for as long as you should.”</p><p>  “To be doing so would be selfish.” Vol’jin turned toward him. “The peace you be offering me, though welcome be it, would be as much a trap as a skull or a helmet.”</p><p>  Taran Zhu’s head came up. “Do you really understand?”</p><p>  “Yes. The parable be not about skulls or helmets; it be about the limitations one accepts when you define yourself. A crab that sees itself as a crab be defined not by the shelter it seeks but by its very need to seek shelter. I be not a crab. My future be not depending on what I can find to act as a shell. I have many more choices.”</p><p>  “And many more obligations.”</p><p>  “Very true.” The troll drew in a deep breath and let it out slowly. Garrosh had betrayed the Horde and would continue to do so. That was in his nature. He allowed himself to be defined by his selfish desires and fears. He would never change, and would resort to many things, terrible things, to solidify his position. In doing so, he would shed rivers of blood and get washed away in the resulting flood.</p><p>  “You, Lord Taran Zhu, have your family to care for here. So does Chen. Tyrathan gonna return to his family.” Vol’jin’s eyes tightened. “The Horde be my family. Just as Tyrathan can’t let his family believe he be dead, nor can I do that to the Horde. They deserve peace, too, and my accepting it here would deny it to them.”</p><p>  “This a shadow hunter cannot do?”</p><p>  “Can or cannot doesn’t matter. Shadow hunter or troll doesn’t matter.” Vol’jin slowly nodded. “Vol’jin Darkspear not gonna do it. That be not who I am. Time come that I be reminding my enemies of that fact and making them pay for the evil they’ve wrought.”</p><p>  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</p><p>  The author would like to thank the following people for their contributions to this book. Without them, this never would have been done. Paul Arena, for suggesting I do a World of Warcraft novel; Scott Gaeta of Cryptozoic, for making introductions; Jerry Chu of Blizzard, for asking Scott to make the introduction; Micky Neilson, Dave Kosak, Cameron Dayton, Joshua Horst, Justin Parker, and Cate Gary of Blizzard, for working so hard to keep my coloring within the lines; Ed Schlesinger, my editor, who has the patience of a saint; Howard Morhaim, my agent, for making the deal work; and my friends Kat Klaybourne, Paul Garabedian, and Jami Kupperman, who conspired to keep me sane through the process of writing. (Which wasn’t that bad. After all, when I needed a break, I could drop into Azeroth and consider it research.)</p><p>  NOTES</p><p>  The story you’ve just read is based in part on characters, situations, and locations from Blizzard Entertainment’s computer game World of Warcraft, an online role-playing experience set in the award-winning Warcraft universe.
