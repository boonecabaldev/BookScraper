The Cataclysm has begun. …</p><p>  Now that you’ve glimpsed the dire fate that awaits Azeroth, you can play a role in sparing the world from impending doom in World of Warcraft’s upcoming third expansion, Cataclysm. The previous two World of Warcraft expansions, The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King, take players to the alien world of Outland and the icy wastes of Northrend. In Cataclysm, players will witness the return of the corrupted Dragon Aspect Deathwing as he awakens from his subterranean slumber and erupts onto the surface of Azeroth, leaving ruin and destruction in his wake. The future hangs in the balance, and as the Horde and Alliance race to the epicenter of the Cataclysm, they will require the help of any and all adventurers willing to risk their lives.</p><p>  To discover the ever-expanding world that has entertained millions around the globe, go to worldofwarcraft.com and download the free trial version.
