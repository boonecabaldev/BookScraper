He gritted his teeth as he saw that the red wax was sealed with the royal seal of Ironforge. He opened it while Drukan, the “special guard” assigned to Anduin to “make sure he was well taken care of, as he was such an honored guest,” looked on sullenly.</p><p>  The Pleasure of your Company is requested at Twilight this Evening. Formal Attire is required and Promptness is appreciated.</p><p>  Anduin resisted the urge to crumple the letter and throw it away. Instead, he smiled politely at Drukan.</p><p>  “Please tell Her Majesty that I shall be happy to attend. I’m sure she’ll want to hear from me as soon as possible.” At least, he thought, this would send off the watchdog for a few moments. He waited until Drukan determined he couldn’t get out of the errand. The dwarf scowled and stomped off.</p><p>  Anduin realized he actually found Drukan’s lack of pretense, interest, and concern refreshing. At least Drukan wasn’t lying about his feelings.</p><p>  Anduin bathed and dressed. Moira may have thought she was pulling the strings on a puppet by demanding his attendance, but by insisting on formal attire, she was giving Anduin permission to wear his crown and other regalia that marked him as her equal. Anduin was well aware of the power such subtleties could convey. Wyll helped him dress, adjusted his crown with about a dozen delicate, infinitesimal tweaks, and then produced a mirror.</p><p>  Anduin blinked a little. He always hated it when adults said he had “grown so much since the last time I saw you,” but he was forced to see the evidence now with his own eyes. He hadn’t paid much attention to what he looked like in the mirror recently, but now he could see that there was a new somberness to his eyes, a set to his jaw. He’d not had anything resembling a sheltered childhood, but he just hadn’t expected the stress of the last few days to be so … visible.</p><p>  “Everything all right, Your Highness?” Wyll inquired.</p><p>  “Yes, Wyll. Everything is fine.”</p><p>  The elderly servant leaned forward. “I am certain your father is working diligently to find a way to secure your release,” he said, pitching his voice very soft.</p><p>  Anduin merely nodded. “Well,” he sighed, “time for dinner.”</p><p>  * * *</p><p>  Anduin was led past the High Seat and discovered that there were only two place settings at a surprisingly small table. Apparently it was to be an intimate gathering.</p><p>  In other words, he was going to be interrogated.</p><p>  He assumed Moira would take the head of the table, so he stood politely beside his chair awaiting her arrival.</p><p>  He waited. And waited. The minutes crept past, and he realized that this, too, was all part of the game that was being played. He understood it better than she thought. He was young and he knew it, and he knew that people underestimated him precisely for that reason. He could use that to his benefit.</p><p>  And, being young, he could stand for a long time without discomfort.</p><p>  At last a door was flung open. A Dark Iron dwarf clad in the livery of Ironforge stepped forward, puffed out his chest, and announced in a voice that would carry in a crowd of hundreds, “Rise to greet Her Majesty, Queen Moira of Ironforge!”</p><p>  Anduin gave the dwarf a half smile and spread his hands slightly to indicate that he was already standing. The prince bowed as Moira entered, still maintaining the proper depth of the bow to an equal. When he straightened, smiling politely, he saw a flicker of annoyance cross Moira’s usually set-in-stone expression of false cordiality.</p><p>  “Ah, Anduin. You are right on time,” Moira said as she swept into the room. A servant pulled out her chair for her, and she settled in, then nodded to Anduin that he might do likewise.</p><p>  “I believe punctuality to be a great virtue,” he said. He did not need to mention that she had kept him waiting. They both knew it.</p><p>  “I trust you have been having a pleasant and enlightening time conversing with my other subjects,” she said, permitting the servant to place the napkin in her lap.</p><p>  Other subjects? Was she implying that Anduin was—no, she wasn’t, but she wanted him to think she was. Anduin smiled pleasantly, nodding thanks to the servant who poured him a glass of water. Another was pouring blood-red wine for Moira. Beer, apparently, was not high on the list of the queen’s favorite beverages.</p><p>  “By that, of course, you mean the Dark Iron dwarves, not just the dwarves of Ironforge,” he said pleasantly. “I’ve not had much conversation with Drukan. Kind of a quiet fellow.”</p><p>  Moira lifted a delicate hand to her mouth, hiding a smile. “Oh, dear, why yes, that is very true. Most of them aren’t talkers, you know. Which is one reason I am so terribly glad that you are here, my dear friend.”</p><p>  Anduin smiled politely and dipped his spoon into the soup.</p><p>  “I am very much looking forward to the long conversations we are certain to have as the weeks and months unfold.”</p><p>  He forced himself not to choke on the soup, swallowing hard. “While I am sure they would be fascinating,” and that at least was not a lie, “I think that my father will need me back before then. I fear you must get as much stimulating conversation as you can with me now.”</p><p>  A flicker in the depths of Moira’s eyes, then the brittle smile. “Oh, I daresay your father will indulge me. Tell me of him. I understand he’s had quite the ordeal.”</p><p>  Anduin was very certain indeed that Moira knew everything there was to know. She did not strike him as someone who would have waited this long to find out what she wanted to learn. Nonetheless, through the soup course and the salad, he told her what was general knowledge of his father’s adventures.</p><p>  “That must have been quite hard on you, Anduin.”</p><p>  He didn’t think she really cared, but a thought occurred to him. He decided to run with it.</p><p>  “It was,” he said, utterly honest. “It’s been even harder to know that he doesn’t approve of the direction in which I wish to take my life. Rumor has it that’s something you would understand.”</p><p>  For the first time since he saw her, she looked at him with a completely unguarded expression, the spoon partway to her mouth, her eyes wide in astonishment. She looked—vulnerable, flustered, and hastened to recover.</p><p>  “Why, whatever do you mean?” She uttered a false laugh.</p><p>  “I hear that Magni wasn’t the best father in the world, even though he might have wanted to be—just like mine,” Anduin said. “That he never quite forgave you for not being the son he wanted.”</p><p>  Her eyes went hard, but they were oddly shiny, as if with unshed tears. When she spoke, it was as if Anduin’s words had broken a dam. “My father was indeed quite disappointed in my flaw of being born female. He could never believe that I might not want to stay here while constantly being reminded that I’d failed him simply by being born. He decided that the only way I could possibly fall in love with a Dark Iron dwarf was if my husband had enchanted me. Well, he did, Anduin. He enchanted me with the concept of respect. Of having people listen to me when I spoke. Of believing that I could rule, even as a female, and rule well. The Dark Irons welcomed me when my own father dismissed me.”</p><p>  She laughed without humor. “That’s the only magic Dagran Thaurissan and the Dark Irons used on me. My father thought them only to be despised, only good enough to fight and kill. Well, they are dwarves, just like any other clan of dwarves—heirs to the earthen. The other dwarves could stand to be reminded of that, and that’s what I intend to do.”</p><p>  “You are the rightful heir,” Anduin agreed. “Magni should have recognized and raised you as such from the day you were born. I’m sorry you only found welcome among the Dark Irons, and you’re right—they’re dwarves, too. But you aren’<br>t going to promote harmony by forcing the people of Ironforge to think like you do. Open up the city. Let people see who the Dark Irons really are, as you have. They can have—”</p><p>  “They can have what I say they can have!” snapped Moira, her voice strident. “And they will do what I say they will do! I have the right of law on my side, and Dagran—the boy that Magni so wished I had been—will rule when I am gone. His father and I …”</p><p>  She paused, and the artificial good cheer suddenly replaced the honest anger. “Do you know,” she said, “that is really the first time this thought has occurred to me.”</p><p>  Discouraged at her reversion to her previous demeanor, Anduin asked, “And what thought might that be?”</p><p>  “Why, that I am an empress, not just a queen.”</p><p>  A chill ran down Anduin’s spine.</p><p>  “Goodness! This changes everything! I have two peoples to rule over. As will my little one, once he comes of age. Such opportunities to be had to build bridges, to bring peace. Do you not agree?”</p><p>  “Peace is always a noble goal,” he said, his heart sinking. He’d had her, just for a moment, had gotten her speaking honestly. But the moment had passed.</p><p>  “Indeed. My, my. Sometimes I think I am just a silly little girl still.”</p><p>  No, you don’t, and neither do I. “I can sympathize. Sometimes I think I’m just a thirteen-year-old boy,” he said.</p><p>  Moira tittered again. “Ah, your humor delights me, Anduin. While I am certain your father misses you, I am quite, quite sure that I cannot bear to part with you just yet.”</p><p>  He gave her a smile that he sincerely hoped did not look quite as fake as it actually was.</p><p>  Several hours later, finally alone in his quarters, Anduin closed the door and leaned against it heavily.</p><p>  Moira wasn’t mad, or under any spell. He wished she were. She’d been wronged, he had to admit, but instead of turning that into a strength, she’d let her resentment eat away at her. She was calculating, in control, and intent upon bequeathing an empire to her son. Some of what she said made sense. Peace was a good thing. But so was liberty.</p><p>  He had to get out of here. Had to let someone know what was going on. He took a deep breath, ran his hand through his hair, and then began to throw things into a small pack he’d brought for day trips with … Light, how he missed Aerin, even now. But he was also glad that she wasn’t here to see what Ironforge had become.</p><p>  He wouldn’t need much—a change of clothing or two, some money. He had brought a few special things from Stormwind, but now he realized that he could live without them in the face of the urgent need to get away as soon as possible. But there was one thing that meant too much, that was too precious, to part with.</p><p>  He’d kept it under the bed since Magni’s death, wrapped in the same cloth as it had been when the dwarven king had presented it to him. He hoped word had not reached Moira about the gift. Somehow he suspected the idea wouldn’t sit well with her.</p><p>  He took a moment to unwrap it and touch the beautiful mace. Fearbreaker. He could use its comfort now. Anduin permitted his hand to close about the weapon for a moment, then he rewrapped it and placed it carefully in the pack.</p><p>  It was time. He had decided not to tell Wyll. The less the elderly servant knew, the easier they would be on him. Anduin took a deep breath, reached his hand in his pocket, and closed his hand about the hearthstone Jaina had given him. Squeezing his eyes tightly shut, Anduin filled his mind with images of Theramore, of Jaina’s cozy little fireplace—</p><p>  —and materialized there.</p><p>  Jaina stared at him. “Anduin, what are you doing here?”</p><p>  The prince of Stormwind didn’t have a thought to spare for her. All he could do was gape at the enormous, angry-looking tauren clad in armor and feathers who stood directly in front of him.</p><p>  TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>  “What is this—” the tauren rumbled, in heavy but intelligible Common.</p><p>  “Baine, Anduin—hold on!” Jaina reached a hand out to each of them.</p><p>  Baine? “Baine Bloodhoof?” Anduin managed.</p><p>  “Anduin Wrynn?”</p><p>  “Everyone hold on!” Jaina cried, more loudly this time. “Baine—I gave Anduin a gift, a stone that enabled him to come visit me whenever he wanted. And given what we’ve heard from Ironforge—or rather, not heard from Ironforge—I’m very, very glad to see you.” She gave him a quick but heartfelt smile. “And Baine—I apologize for his unexpected arrival, but I believe you can trust Anduin.”</p><p>  “His father has no love for the Horde,” Baine said. “I believe you did not anticipate this, Jaina, but—”</p><p>  “I am not my father,” Anduin said quietly. He was calming down now, starting to figure out what was going on. Baine Bloodhoof was the son of the tauren high chieftain, Cairne. Cairne and Thrall were good friends, and the tauren were not as hostile to the Alliance as some of the other races that comprised the Horde. If Jaina was on good terms with Thrall, it stood to reason that she would not be averse to meetings—even secret ones—with a representative of Cairne’s.</p><p>  His composure seemed to impress the young bull. Baine relaxed slightly, regarding him with more curiosity than hostility now. “No,” he said, “we are not our fathers. Even if we wished to be.”</p><p>  There was something in the tone that alerted Anduin that something was very wrong here. He glanced at Jaina, questioningly. Now that he looked at her, she looked strained and unhappy.</p><p>  “Sit down, both of you,” she said, indicating the hearth. Baine was far too big to fit into any of the chairs. “I think you two have long stories to share.”</p><p>  “I intend no offense,” Baine said, continuing to stand, “but I risk a great deal even coming to see you, Lady Jaina. To confide in the heir to the crown of Stormwind? I fear you ask too much.”</p><p>  “I understand your trepidation,” said Jaina, “and I know right now you’re both focused on your own problems. But bear in mind I am harboring both of you right now, and so you’re just going to have to get along.”</p><p>  “How can you harbor a fellow Alliance member?” Baine snorted.</p><p>  “Because Magni Bronzebeard is dead; his daughter, Moira Bronzebeard, has returned to Ironforge from Shadowforge City with a bunch of Dark Iron dwarves and is declaring herself empress; she’s got Ironforge in a lockdown; and she’s going to be very, very upset that I got out,” Anduin said bluntly. Baine was right. There was no reason he should trust Anduin, prince of Stormwind … unless Anduin gave him a reason to. Besides, if he didn’t know already, he soon would. Moira couldn’t keep her intent secret forever. Baine’s massive, horned head swiveled around, and he blinked at Anduin for a moment.</p><p>  “Some would call you traitor for revealing that information, young prince,” he said quietly.</p><p>  “What Moira is doing is wrong, even if she is the legitimate heir,” Anduin said. “Some of her goals and plans make sense. But how she’s going about them—I can’t approve of that. Just because she’s a dwarf and the daughter of a friend doesn’t mean I blindly support her. And just because you’re a member of the Horde doesn’t mean I wouldn’t support you.”</p><p>  He kept his gaze on Baine, but out of the corner of his eye he saw Jaina relax slightly, hopefully.</p><p>  “He has met Thrall, and they like and respect each other,” Jaina said. “You could ask for no better endorsement, Baine.”</p><p>  Baine nodded, though his ears flapped, presumably in distress. “Had not Thrall left, though, I would have no need of your aid, and …” He paused, and took a deep breath, blowing it out through his nostrils. “And my father would still be alive.”</p><p>  Anduin gasped and looked at Jaina. Her eyes were sad, and she nodded. “Baine already told me,” she said quietly.</p><p>  “I’m so sorry,” he said, and meant it. Whatever anyone thought of the Horde, everyone agreed that Cairne had been a good, decent leader and a good … man? Person? But it was not unexpected. Cairne was old. It seemed strange that Baine seemed so upset. No, not upset—anyone who loved his father would be upset at his passing—but … agitated. Distressed.<br> “What happened?”</p><p>  “Sit down,” Jaina said, not unkindly. This time Anduin and Baine complied, taking seats on the floor. Jaina poured tea for all of them, put the cups on a tray, and sat down on the floor, cross-legged, herself. Anduin took a cup, and, after a moment, so did Baine. He regarded the tiny cup in his massive hand and gave a little chuckle—possibly the first, Anduin suspected, he had uttered since learning of his father’s death.</p><p>  Jaina glanced from one to the other. “Neither of you knows how much I wish we three were meeting under different circumstances,” she said quietly, “particularly yours, Baine. But at least we are meeting. Maybe this conversation tonight will lay the groundwork for future, more formal conversations between our people.”</p><p>  Anduin lifted his cup. “To better times,” he said. Jaina lifted hers and clinked it gently. After a moment Baine did so, too.</p><p>  “I think … my father would be glad of this,” he said. “Prince Anduin. Let me tell you what suffering this past day has brought.”</p><p>  “I’m listening,” the prince of Stormwind said.</p><p>  * * *</p><p>  “Are you listening to me?” Moira screamed.</p><p>  “Aye, Your Excellency, I—”</p><p>  “How could you let him escape?”</p><p>  “I dinna ken! We’ve arrested th’ magi. … Perhaps a warlock summoning frae outside?” Drukan was reaching here, and he knew it.</p><p>  “We have wards up against such a thing!” Moira was pacing now. It was early morning, and this was not the sort of news she had wished to awaken to. Not at all. She had simply thrown on a wrap when Drukan had sent her an agitated message that her prize pet had escaped. “No, it must have been something else. Perhaps you simply drank too much and slept while he tiptoed past you!”</p><p>  Drukan frowned but bit back a retort. “I dinna drink on duty, Yer Excellency. And even if he had slipped past me, he would not have gotten past the guards stationed at every entrance.”</p><p>  Moira placed a hand to her throbbing temples and massaged them. “How is not important. We …” A crafty smile curved her lips. “Perhaps we are mistaken. Perhaps my pretty little caged bird of a prince has not escaped after all.”</p><p>  <br> </p></p></body>
