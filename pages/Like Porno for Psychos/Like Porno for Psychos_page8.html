It sounded like the entire city was fucking.</p><p>  “What’s going on?” Simon asked.</p><p>  “Let’s go check.”</p><p>  We crept over to a bedroom window and peered out at the street. It was chaos. At first I thought I was watching a riot. There were bodies strewn across the sidewalk, on the hood of cars, inside cars with doors open, in the middle of the street, bodies in various stages of undress entwined, kneeling, laying, squatting, sitting, on all fours, on their bellies, in every position imaginable. It took my mind a moment to adjust before it became clear. They were fucking. Everywhere. Everyone furiously fucking. An orgy that stretched as far as the eye could see in all directions. It was a sex addict’s paradise.</p><p>  “Come on!”</p><p>  I took Simon’s hand and we ran out into the street, still naked into the sweating, moaning, undulating tide of humanity. Immediately, I felt a dozen hands groping for me, stroking and caressing. I felt their wet mouths, their lips, tongues, breasts, and penises all over me and I fell down among them, taken away by the greatest aphrodisiac the world has ever known. Hope. Freedom. After decades of fear, decades of worry and caution, we were finally liberated. We had the cure.</p><p>  We fucked long into the night, pleasure became pain as flesh began to chafe and then to tear and bleed. More people came to join us and soon it became clear that we could not stop. Whatever they injected us with was more than the cure to AIDS, more than a cure for STDS, it had stimulated something in our brains, in the most primal region of the amagdala where our sexual desire and our survival instincts were housed and caused a riot there. The desire to eat, to sleep, to drink had all been suppressed in favor of one lone instinct. Procreation. Again and again we expelled our bodily fluids without replacing them, even pausing to drink was no longer an option.</p><p>  The day ended and became night and then day again and we continued fucking. In agony, our bodies crashed together, bleeding, screaming, but still vigorously, furiously fucking.</p><p>  “I love you, Simon.”</p><p>  “I love you too, Shark.”</p><p>  “Mark. My real name is Mark.”</p><p>  “I love you too, Mark.”</p><p>  I didn’t mean it and neither did she. It just seemed like the right thing to say. I’d fucked more than a dozen women more than a hundred times in the last twenty-four hours yet I kept coming back to her, drawn to her. I was certain that I would die with her and that it wouldn’t be long. My last ejaculation had been almost entirely blood. Her vagina and anus was now just a ragged bleeding maw sopping and dripping with the semen of countless men, still I thrust into it in a maniacal fervor. My lungs burned, my muscles ached, and my penis had sloughed off most of its skin. I looked into Simon’s eyes and laughed.</p><p>  Twenty-four hours ago, we both thought we would live forever, that the cure would make us invincible. Now, we were going to fuck each other to death. She laughed too then screamed as another orgasm ripped through her starving dehydrated body and she continued to fuck me.</p><p>  Make love to me</p><p>  I want to scream in the lascivious agonies</p><p>  of your love</p><p>  Burn me alive</p><p>  in the voluptuous heat</p><p>  of your eyes</p><p>  Shatter my skull</p><p>  With the ballistic speed</p><p>  of your tongue</p><p>  Make Love to Me</p><p>  I want to perish</p><p>  impaled on your tongue</p><p>  I want to drown</p><p>  in your desires</p><p>  I want to sacrifice myself</p><p>  on the altar</p><p>  of your sex</p><p>  I want to die</p><p>  in the gleam</p><p>  of your eyes</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p><br> </p></p></body>
