I saw what was left of it.”</p><p>  “We have heard,” she said. “From a very trusted source. But—you’ve seen it. I was also warned that from there, the Horde plans to march on Theramore.”</p><p>  Kalec paled even more. “Jaina—you’re completely unprepared for them.”</p><p>  “We were told their numbers are strong,” Jaina said. “And that, yes, right now, we aren’t prepared for them. But thanks to the warning, I’ve had a chance to send out some requests for aid.”</p><p>  “I don’t know if that will be enough,” said Kalecgos. “Jaina, every race of the Horde was there. They have all but wiped Northwatch from the face of Azeroth. The only things that remain are rubble and—and pyres. They’ve not dispersed. The army—and it is an army—is still gathered. I wish I could truly show you what I saw. If your requests for aid are not met, and quickly, you’re not going to survive the attack.”</p><p>  “And then Garrosh will summarily destroy the rest of the Alliance footholds,” said Tervosh. Kalec nodded, his eyes somber.</p><p>  Jaina looked at them, then at Pained and Kinndy. “You’re all acting as if the Horde has already won. I won’t accept that.” She narrowed her eyes and jutted her chin out defiantly. “I believe Kalec when he says they have an army encamped at Northwatch. But if they are there now, then they’re not marching. And if they’re not marching, then they’re not ready to march. That means we still have time.”</p><p>  She moved to the table, feeling Kalec’s curious gaze upon her. “Look. Here’s Northwatch.” She tapped a slender finger on the map. “And here’s Theramore.” She drew her finger down and to the right. “Over here is Brackenwall Village. Some Horde live there, but it’s not a military outpost. It does stand between Fort Triumph and us, however.” Fort Triumph was a rather newly established military base. If there had been more time, Jaina thought, it would have sent reinforcements to Northwatch. It might be too late for Northwatch Hold, but she prayed it wasn’t too late for Theramore.</p><p>  “We’ll have the soldiers from Fort Triumph march through Dustwallow Marsh. They can avoid Brackenwall if they’re careful. We’ll also send out runners to Forward Command.”</p><p>  “Any who are left,” Kalec said. “When I passed over the area, it seemed deserted.”</p><p>  “Most of them probably went to help Northwatch,” said Kinndy quietly.</p><p>  Which, Jaina thought with a pang, meant most of them were dead. She shook her golden head, almost physically trying to clear the image from her mind’s eye.</p><p>  “Any who escaped the battle probably regrouped at Fort Triumph rather than Ratchet,” she said. “It’s the first place we should look for survivors.”</p><p>  Kalec stepped beside her, his focus on the map. She looked at him in query, expecting him to have a comment. He shook his head. “Go on,” he said.</p><p>  “Theramore is both uniquely vulnerable and highly defensible, depending on how fast reinforcements can get here. If we act quickly, Stormwind can send several ships, and any Horde vessels that attack will, hopefully, not even get close enough for their crews to come ashore.” She placed a finger on the map and drew a half circle around Theramore.</p><p>  “If the Horde reaches the harbor first,” Pained said, “we will have no chance at all.”</p><p>  Jaina turned to look at her. “That is true,” she said. “Perhaps we should all just lay down our arms and go to the dock so we can greet the Horde and thus save ourselves the trouble of a battle.”</p><p>  Pained’s purple-pink cheeks flushed a darker hue. “You know I do not advocate that.”</p><p>  “Of course you don’t. But we have to go into this battle thinking—no, knowing—we will succeed. I welcome all comments about flaws in my planning,” she said, addressing this to Kalecgos. Pained, Kinndy, and Tervosh already knew Jaina was open to constructive criticism. “But comments like that, Pained, do nothing save drag us down. Theramore has defended itself well in the past. We will do so again.”</p><p>  “Whom have you sent letters to so far?” asked Kalec.</p><p>  Jaina smiled a little. “Letters? None. Nor have I teleported. I have a way to instantly communicate with King Varian, young Anduin, and the Council of Three Hammers.”</p><p>  “That must be interesting,” said Kalec. “From what I hear, the three dwarves seem inclined to agree on very little.”</p><p>  Not so long ago, Ironforge’s leader had been Magni Bronzebeard. In an attempt to better understand the unease of the earth prior to the Cataclysm, Magni had performed a rite to make him “one with the earth.” It had succeeded, after a fashion. Magni had been turned into diamond, indeed becoming one with the earth. After a brief time of chaos—during which Magni’s daughter, Moira, attempted to claim the Ironforge throne and rule with the Dark Iron dwarves—order was restored when a council was formed instead of continuing the tradition of a single ruler. Each clan of dwarves—Bronzebeard, Wildhammer, and Dark Iron—now had a representative. The ruling body was called the Council of Three Hammers, and while its members cooperated, getting unanimity on anything was a challenge.</p><p>  “It would seem that no one likes the idea of the Horde running Kalimdor,” Jaina said. “While they might argue some of the details, all three were in agreement about that.”</p><p>  Kalecgos suddenly looked uneasy. Jaina thought she knew why. Gently, she placed a hand on his arm. “You are a dragon, Kalecgos,” she said. “You don’t need to be involved in this. Especially since you are a former Aspect who is already preoccupied with tracking down a stolen artifact.”</p><p>  He smiled gratefully. “Thank you for understanding, Jaina. But… I would see none of you come to harm.”</p><p>  “Lady Jaina knows what she’s doing,” said Kinndy. “The Alliance will come to protect its own.”</p><p>  Kalecgos shook his head. “This is more than a scuffle or a raid on a small village. If the Horde succeeds, Garrosh would not be overconfident to assume that he could indeed control Kalimdor. I… will need to think on this before offering my aid. I’m sorry, Jaina.”</p><p>  He looked into her eyes, and she knew with perfect understanding how much this was tormenting him. Their hands, seemingly of their own volition, met and clasped. Jaina found herself reluctant to let go, but she had time only for the defense of Theramore right now.</p><p>  “We need to take steps immediately,” she said. “I’ll go contact Varian. Pained, you go among the soldiers, both here in Theramore proper and those stationed along the roads. If Sentry Point is without at least one horse, get them one. They need to be able to ride swiftly to inform us if the Horde approaches.”</p><p>  The night elf nodded, saluted, and left at a running trot. “What about the civilians?” asked Kinndy. “Should we tell them?”</p><p>  Jaina considered, her brow furrowing in thought. “Yes,” she said finally. “Theramore was originally a martial city. Those who choose to dwell here know its strategic position. We’ve been fortunate ere now. They will understand and obey our orders.”</p><p>  She turned to Tervosh. “You and Kinndy start going door-to-door informing the citizens. No more ships are to set sail from this port. We need every single vessel we can muster. Those civilians who wish to leave may, though I believe they’ll be safer here than in the marsh with the Horde approaching. The gates will be open until sundown, at which time they will be closed and not reopened until the danger has passed. I’m also putting a curfew into effect at two bells beyond sundown.”</p><p>  “Why not at sunset?” Kalec queried.</p><p>  “Because they are people, and they need to feel like people, not trapped animals. Two hours past sundown will give everyone the chance to have a meal at an inn with their family, or a drink or two with friends by the fire. Such simple things will remind them, when the fighting does come, what they are fighting for: not just an ideal or even their own survival, but also their homes, their<br> families, their way of life.”</p><p>  Kalecgos looked surprised. “That… had not occurred to me.”</p><p>  “And two hours isn’t really enough for anyone to get into trouble,” said Kinndy. “Good idea.” Jaina gave her a bemused glance and wondered how she knew about such things.</p><p>  “Thank you, world-weary one,” Jaina said, smiling as the gnome rolled her eyes. “Any questions?”</p><p>  “Nope,” said Kinndy. “Come on, Tervosh. I’ll go down to the harbor; you go talk to the soldiers at Foothold Citadel. While you’re there, find out what supplies Dr. VanHowzen is going to need to treat the injured. I’m sure there are many civilians here with first aid training who will be glad to help.”</p><p>  Tervosh suppressed a grin. “Yes, boss,” he said as Kinndy waved absently at Jaina and Kalec and started descending the stairs at a brisk pace. Shrugging, Tervosh followed her.</p><p>  “Your apprentice is most self-assured,” Kalecgos said.</p><p>  “A quality I have no desire to see her lose,” said Jaina. “Few things are more dangerous than an insecure mage. Indecision at a crucial moment can cost lives.”</p><p>  He nodded. “Very true. Now… what can I be doing to help?”</p><p>  “I will let you know. First, I need to contact King Varian,” she said, adding apologetically, “I’m not sure he’d be particularly glad to know there is a blue dragon here.”</p><p>  “Ah, yes, I can quite understand that,” said Kalec. “I will return to my quarters until you send for me.”</p><p>  “No, you can come,” Jaina said. “Just don’t stand in front of the mirror.”</p><p>  He looked at her, baffled, and she smiled.</p><p>  • • •</p><p>  Kalecgos followed Jaina as they went from the library, which of course housed hundreds of books, to her parlor, which probably only housed dozens. Jaina stepped up to one shelf and touched three books in what struck Kalec as a very precise order. He was not altogether surprised when the bookshelf slid aside to reveal a mirror, oval and not elaborately framed, hidden behind the books. Kalec blinked. In the mirror, he saw Jaina’s reflection and his own.</p><p>  “You did mention a mirror. I assume there is more to this than a way to discreetly tell me I need to shave?” he joked.</p><p>  “Much more,” she said. “It operates using the same methodology, the same math”—she bowed slightly—“that a portal does. Except it’s much simpler and more basic. Portals actually have to be able to physically transport someone somewhere. The mirror just allows viewing of a different place and, if the timing is right, other people. I’m going to use this to contact Varian. Let’s hope he’s nearby, or we will have to try again.”</p><p>  Kalec shook his head, again marveling at the wonderful lack of complexity of the younger races and their spells. “I know of this sort of spell. Very old, and very simple. Just like the ‘costume’ spell the thieves utilized to hide the Focusing Iris from my detection.”</p><p>  “Yet your flight doesn’t use such things?”</p><p>  “Most would think it beneath them to use a garden-variety spell like this one,” he said, adding quickly, “but I think it’s brilliant.”</p><p>  “I’m trying not to be insulted,” said Jaina. She said the words lightly, but her brow had furrowed again.</p><p>  “I,” said Kalec, reaching for her hands, “am both clumsy and rude. I do think it’s brilliant. We dragons…” He struggled to explain the mentality of dragonflights, especially that of the blues. “Dragons seem to think that the more complicated a thing is—the longer it takes to perform, the more ingredients it has, and the more people it requires to participate—the better it is. That goes for clothing, meals, magic, art—everything. They would rather sit down for days and design a laborious spell to teleport a thing directly to their hands than simply get up and fetch the saltcellar.”</p><p>  That got a smile out of her, and Kalec was glad. “So, you like that I’m simple and uncomplicated?” Jaina queried.</p><p>  All the humor fled him. “I like you,” was all he could say. “I’ve seen you be simple, and I’ve seen you be complex, and it all suits you. You’re Jaina. And… I like Jaina.”</p><p>  She did not let go of his hands; instead she looked down at them. “That is high praise, coming from a dragon,” she said.</p><p>  He placed a finger beneath her chin and tilted it up so that she looked into his eyes. “If that is praise, then you have earned it.”</p><p>  Color suffused her cheeks and she stepped back, releasing his hands and smoothing her robe unnecessarily. “Well… thank you. Now, please, move all the way over into that corner. You should be out of Varian’s line of sight there.”</p><p>  “I obey, my lady,” he said, bowing and retreating to the corner she had indicated.</p><p>  Jaina turned to face the mirror. She paused for a moment to tidy a stray lock of hair and inhaled a deep, steadying breath. Composed, she murmured an incantation and waved her hands. As Kalec watched, her face was bathed not in the ordinary hues of lamp or sunlight, but in a soft blue tint.</p><p>  “Jaina!” said Varian. “It is good to see you.”</p><p>  “And you, Varian. Although I wish I were contacting you to ask how Anduin’s studies are going.”</p><p>  “It sounds as if I should be wishing that too. What’s happening?”</p><p>  Succinctly she informed him of the situation. Word had not yet reached him about the fall of Northwatch Hold. Varian remained silent as Jaina spoke, interrupting only occasionally for clarification. She told him she had received a warning that the Horde’s reach far exceeded its current grasp of Northwatch.</p><p>  “Garrosh wants nothing less than the entirety of Kalimdor,” Jaina said quietly. “He will take Theramore and then launch his forces across the continent all the way to Teldrassil.”</p><p>  “If Theramore falls, he could do it, too,” growled Varian. “Damn it, Jaina, I always warned you that this Horde you are so fond of would turn on you like a tamed wild beast!”</p><p>  Kalec raised an eyebrow, but Jaina remained calm. “It is clear to me that Garrosh is the driving force behind all this. The Horde would never have done anything like this under Thrall’s leadership.”</p><p>  “But Thrall is not leading the Horde, and now Theramore—indeed, all of Kalimdor—might pay the price!”</p><p>  She didn’t rise to the bait. “It is clear, then, that you realize the severity of the situation.”</p><p>  A sigh. “I do,” he said, “and in answer to your unasked question, yes, Stormwind will stand with Theramore. I’ll divert the 7th Legion’s naval fleet toward Theramore immediately.” There was a pause. “And, as things seem to be quiet for once in at least a few parts of this world, I’ll notify several of my finest generals to report to you as well. They’ll give you a hand with the city’s defense, and together you can hammer out a strategy that will send those Horde dogs home with their tails between their legs.”</p><p>  She smiled gratefully. “Varian—thank you.”</p><p>  “Don’t thank me yet,” the king of Stormwind said. “It’s going to take a few days. You’ll want a good-sized force to greet the Horde, and some of the generals I want to send to you are stationed in rather distant places.”</p><p>  Kalec’s heart sank. The Horde was only a day’s march, perhaps two, and its forces were already gathered at Northwatch. Varian’s strategy was a good one, so far as it went. But all the king’s generals and all the king’s ships could not save Theramore if they arrived an hour too late. He wished he could speak but had to content himself with clenching his fists in frustration. What was worse than his own dismay was seeing Jaina looking stunned and worried.</p><p>  “Are you sure? Varian, Ka—one of my scouts said he saw the Horde still assembled in full numbers at Northwatch.”</p><p>  “If they are still gathered and not yet marching,” said Varian, “they obviously are not interested in a swift conquest. They have their own plots. I will move as fast as I may, Jaina, but nothing can change the fact that it will take time to assemble any kind of a fleet that would make a difference. I’m sorry. It’s the best I can do.”</p><p>  Jaina nodded. “Of course I know that, Varian. And you ra<br>ise a good point. I’ll be contacting the other Alliance leaders as well. The kaldorei may be able to send both ships and warriors; the dwarves, warriors and perhaps gryphons. I think even the draenei would be willing to help.”</p><p>  “I will speak with Greymane,” said Varian. “I know well a few worgen on the battlefield will strike fear even into the hearts of the more bestial members of the Horde.”</p><p>  “Thank you,” Jaina said. “Sometimes it’s easy to feel a bit deserted here on this island.”</p><p>  “Well, don’t,” said Varian, but his voice was kind. “Contact me again in a few hours, and we will share our information. Take care, Jaina. We will win this yet.”</p><p>  “I know we will,” said Jaina.</p><p>  And as the soft blue light of the magic mirror faded and her features returned to normal hues, Kalecgos resolved that whatever happened, he would do all he could to make sure Jaina’s faith was justified.</p><p>  11</p><p>  Four days. Four full days had the massed army of the Horde waited for the order to march on Theramore. Garrosh had stayed in his warchief’s battle tent, and no request for an audience had been granted.</p><p>  Loyal the Horde might have been to its warchief, but patient its members were not. There had been muttered complaints, quietly voiced questions. Baine, who had complaints and questions aplenty, had kept his sharp ears tuned to the murmurs and had discreetly spoken with those who, like he, were concerned about this inexplicable delay.</p><p>  He and Hamuul Runetotem set up a meeting some distance away from the ruin, near a giant tree that had been on the right side of the Great Divide when the land had bucked and heaved during the Cataclysm, and were the first to arrive. They all came one by one: Captain Frandis Farley and a few companions from the Forsaken; Kelantir Bloodblade; Captain Zixx Grindergear, who commanded one of the zeppelins, and his first mate, Blar Xyzzik; Margolag, who represented Eitrigg; and more than a few of his own tauren. The last ones to come were Vol’jin and two of his people. Baine was both pleased and worried to see his friend present for this meeting.</p><p>  <br> </p></p></body>
